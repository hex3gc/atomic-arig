planetaris-heavy-glass=Reinforced silica glass

[recipe-name]
planetaris-glass-panel=Silica glass
planetaris-heavy-glass=Reinforced glass
h3-arig-sandstone-brick-concrete=Concrete from sandstone
h3-arig-sandstone-brick-refined-concrete=Refined concrete from sandstone
h3-arig-sandstone-brick-compression=Sandstone compression

[technology-name]
planetaris-automation-4=Atomic automation
planetaris-hyper-transport-belt=Hyper transport belt

[technology-description]
planetaris-automation-4=Automation machinery enhanced with nuclear energy.
planetaris-compression-science=Allows study into advanced material compression and atomic manipulation.
planet-discovery-arig=A hot, irradiated planet where vast deserts and deep wells of oil contain useful resources and the secrets to harnessing the atom. The constant sandstorms make non-viable the use of standard robots and the majority of the surface is not suitable for building without proper foundation. (Warning: Cargo drops are prohibited unless researched.)
atomic-construction-robots=Flying robots with improved speed, cargo size and power consumption.
atomic-logistic-robots=Flying robots with improved speed, cargo size and power consumption.

[mod-setting-name]
h3-arig-removeContainer=Remove container research
h3-arig-difficultBelts=Higher tech Logistics 4
h3-arig-lubricatedPress=Lubricated press

[mod-setting-description]
h3-arig-removeContainer=Removes the big container.
h3-arig-difficultBelts=Pushes Logistics 4 to later in the tech tree. Requires Gleba, Fulgora, Vulcanus and Arig techs and materials to craft, but bumps the speed up to 90 items per second.
h3-arig-lubricatedPress=Adds lubricant as a catalyst to the chemical recipes of the Press in exchange for increased yields.
