# Atomic Arig

Arig from [Planetaris Unbounded: Arig](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/planetaris-unbounded) is a high quality planet with a unique feel and a fun niche of building within limited space while sifting resources from the endless dunes of its surface. However, I found its rewards a bit lacking in comparison with some other planets, and wanted to give the player more reason to go there before Vulcanus or Fulgora.

**Atomic Arig** attempts to achieve this by merging Arig's tech tree with [Nuclear Science](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/atan-nuclear-science) and making uranium a resource unique to the planet. No longer will energy be a solved problem once you start mining uranium on Nauvis-- you'll have to work for that privilege.

### Changes

---

##### Progression
Arig's tech tree and recipe progression has been changed in multiple places to place it alongside the other inner planets, so it is no longer locked behind Vulcanus. Rather than rushing to Vulcanus as soon as space science is unlocked, this gives the player a choice between what they value more: The productivity boosts from foundries and logistics tech from Vulcanus, or the utility of nuclear power and advanced automation tech found on Arig.

You'll find yourself in more of a challenging position on Nauvis since nuclear power is no longer an option in the early game. Better start stocking up on solar panels.

##### Uranium
Uranium can now be mined on the surface of Arig, or sifted from its sands. This allows you to make Arig your center for nuclear production without the risk of running out of the green stuff, and with the option of mining more for higher yields.

Arig's science now includes Uranium-238 in its recipe, and additionally unlocks all relevant nuclear sciences. This includes the Atom Forge from Nuclear Science and Arig's Assembling Machine 4, which have been modified to require the planet's higher tier circuit for access to highly power-efficient crafting. The Quantum Processor also uses this circuit, now making Arig an essential planet for late game progression.

Optionally, [Atomic Robots](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/AtomicRobotsFix2Boost) can be included as a fully compatible and energy-efficient upgrade to robots using exports from Arig and Fulgora.

##### Lubricated Compression (Optional)
The Press is the unique building from Arig, and in the interest of making it a more useful option for production, many of its recipes have been modified to increase its yields by using lubricant as an additive. This shifts the cost of chemical processes more towards heavy oil, giving you more ways to use it when extracted from Arig's crust. Also adds concrete and refined concrete recipes that don't require water.

##### Advanced Logistics (Optional)
This option pushes Arig's tier 4 belts further down the tech tree, using ingredients from each inner planet. In exchange for the added complexity, the belt speed has been increased to 90 items per second, allowing for massive throughput.

##### Miscellany and Compatibility
Basic compatiblity with [Maraxsis](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/maraxsis) and [Paracelsin](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Paracelsin) have been included. Glass and concrete productivity will include Arig's recipes.

The balance of the planet has been tweaked in many small ways based on my judgment and playtesting alone, so if anything feels unusual or unsatisfying, please start a discussion thread so we can talk about gameplay.
